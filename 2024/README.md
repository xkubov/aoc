# Advent of Code 2024

This is the first year I am taking part in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I chose to implement all solutions using Go. I hadn't used Go before this challenge, so I used this as a learning experience.


## Solutions

For each day I measured runtime using:

```bash
$ go build ./day-x.go
$ time ./day-x input.txt
```

The measured runtime is combined for both puzzle 1 and puzzle 2.

I used go1.23.3 for darwin/arm64.


| Day  | Solution                   | Runtime |
| ---- | ----                       | ----    |
| 1    | [Day 1](day_01/day-1.go)   | 40ms    |
| 2    | [Day 2](day_02/day-2.go)   | 13ms    |
| 3    | [Day 3](day_03/day-3.go)   | 19ms    |
| 4    | [Day 4](day_04/day-4.go)   | 27ms    |
| 5    | [Day 5](day_05/day-05.go)  | 18ms    |
| 6    | [Day 6](day_06/day-06.go)  | 6.6s    |
| 7    | [Day 7](day_07/day-07.go)  | 748ms   |
| 8    | [Day 8](day_08/day-08.go)  | 23ms    |
| 9    | [Day 9](day_09/day-09.go)  | 756ms   |
| 10   | [Day 10](day_10/day-10.go) | 295ms   |
| 11   | [Day 11](day_11/day-11.go) | 334ms   |
| 12   | [Day 12](day_12/day-12.go) | 371ms   |
| 13   | [Day 13](day_13/day-13.go) | 20ms    |
| 14   | [Day 14](day_14/day-14.go) | 4s      |
